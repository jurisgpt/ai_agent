        In order to use this tool, you need an OpenAI API key, and a Zapier NLA API key:\n\n
        - **OpenAI**: In order to use ChatGPT capabilities, you need to have an account with OpenAI and have an API key,
        which you can get from [here](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api). Note that the keys are entered as passwords, 
        and are not saved here. However, if you don't feel comfortable entering your OpenAI API key, I will add other 
        open-source LLM options in the future.\n
        - **Zapier**: This toolkit also uses the [Zapier NLA](https://nla.zapier.com/docs/) (Natural Language Actions) 
        API. Once you create a Zapier account, you can set up action settings for the API 
        [here](https://nla.zapier.com/providers/). Your action settings determine what your API key will have access to, 
        such as your email, Slack, and 5000+ other applications made available through Zapier. The portal's sidebar will 
        inform you what you have access to once you input your key. 
        
        I recommend adding actions for your daily tools like gmail, calendar, docs, sheets, and Slack to get the 
        most out of your AI assistant!
