# Your Personal AI Agent ðŸ¤–

This repository uses Zapier, Langchain, and OpenAI's ChatGPT to create a personal AI agent for you that can 
- read and create emails, Slack messages, reminders and calendars events
- interact with users and documents
- or any of the other 5000 applications provided through Zapier

In order to use this tool, you need an OpenAI API key, and a Zapier NLA API key:

- **OpenAI**: In order to use ChatGPT capabilities, you need to have an account with OpenAI and have an API key, which you can get from [here](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api). Note that the keys are entered as passwords, and are not saved here. However, if you don't feel comfortable entering your OpenAI API key, I will add other open-source LLM options in the future.
  
- **Zapier**: This toolkit also uses the [Zapier NLA](https://nla.zapier.com/docs/) (Natural Language Actions) API. Once you create a Zapier account, you can set up action settings for the API [here](https://nla.zapier.com/providers/). Your action settings determine what your API key will have access to, such as your email, Slack, and 5000+ other applications made available through Zapier. The portal's sidebar will inform you what you have access to once you input your key. 
        
I recommend adding actions for your daily tools like gmail, calendar, docs, sheets, and Slack to get the most out of your AI assistant!
